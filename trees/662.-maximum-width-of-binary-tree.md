# 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the **maximum width** of the given tree_.

The **maximum width** of a tree is the maximum **width** among all levels.

The **width** of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is **guaranteed** that the answer will in the range of a **32-bit** signed integer.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/14/maximum-width-of-binary-tree-v3.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]
</strong><strong>Output: 7
</strong><strong>Explanation: The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/width3-tree.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [1,3,2,5]
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3000]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`



## Solution.



```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return 0;
        unsigned long long ans = 0;
        queue<pair<TreeNode*,unsigned long long>> qq;
        qq.push({root,0});

        while(!qq.empty()){
            unsigned long long sizee = qq.size();
            unsigned long long minn = qq.front().second;
            unsigned long long first,last;

            for(int i=0; i<sizee; i++){
                TreeNode* temp = qq.front().first;
                unsigned long long currid = qq.front().second-minn;
                qq.pop();

                if(i==0) first=currid;
                if(i==sizee-1) last=currid;

                if(temp->left) qq.push({temp->left,currid*2+1});
                if(temp->right) qq.push({temp->right,currid*2+2});
            }
            ans = max(ans,last-first+1);
        }
        return ans;

    }
};
```

Goal: find lowest common ancestor.

1. keep track of nodes and thei index in pair in queue.&#x20;
2. do a bfs keep a track of first and last.
3. do curr - min to get the required index the tree will look like:





To illustrate how the tree would look like during traversal, imagine the binary tree as an array, where each node's position is defined by its index in the array:

```
            1 (0)
           /     \
      2 (1)      3 (2)
     /   \      /    \
  4 (3)  5 (4) 6 (5)  7 (6)
```

In this diagram, each node is labeled with its value followed by its index in parentheses. During the BFS traversal, nodes are labeled with these indices for computing the width of the binary tree.



so like this but instead we will do 0,12,1234 and so on. 2n+1 and 2n+2.
