# 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and a character `target`. There are **at least two different** characters in `letters`.

Return _the smallest character in_ `letters` _that is lexicographically greater than_ `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
</strong><strong>Output: "c"
</strong><strong>Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
</strong><strong>Output: "f"
</strong><strong>Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
</strong><strong>Output: "x"
</strong><strong>Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= letters.length <= 10`<sup>`4`</sup>
* `letters[i]` is a lowercase English letter.
* `letters` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
* `letters` contains at least two different characters.
* `target` is a lowercase English letter.



## Solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        int n = letters.size();
        int l = 0;
        int r = n-1;

        while(l<=r){
            int m = (l+r)/2;
            if(letters[m]<=target){
                l=m+1;
            }else{
                r=m-1;
            }
        }

        return letters[l%n];
    }
};
```
