# 337. House Robber III (Tree+DP)

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return _the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police**_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob1-tree.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 7
</strong><strong>Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 9
</strong><strong>Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10`<sup>`4`</sup>`]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 10`<sup>`4`</sup>

## Solution.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        pair<int,int> ans = dfs(root);
        //this dfs with return a pair like [sum includont root, sum excluding root]
        return max(ans.first, ans.second);
    }

    pair<int,int> dfs(TreeNode* root){
        //base condititon
        if(!root) return {0,0};

        //find maxes of with and without root for left and right
        pair<int,int> lside = dfs(root->left);
        pair<int,int> rside = dfs(root->right);

        //calc with root and without root
        //value of root + calue of returned value(without root aka pair[1])
        int withroot = root->val + lside.second + rside.second;
        //value of max(with,without root of child 1) + max(with,without root of child 2)
        int withoutroot = max(lside.first, lside.second) + max(rside.first,rside.second);

        return {withroot,withoutroot};
    }
};
```

#### Complexity

* **TC = O(n)**
* **SC = O(h)** (O(log n) for balanced tree, O(n) worst case).
