# 213. House Robber II

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [2,3,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
</strong>Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1,2,3]
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`



## Solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        // same as house robber but circular condition needs to be added
        // run for 2 conditions: skip 1st house, skip last house and return max since u can only choose one of them

        int n=nums.size();
        if(n==1) return nums[0];
        if(n==2) return max(nums[0],nums[1]);

        //skip last house
        int l2l = nums[0];
        int l = max(nums[0],nums[1]);
        for(int i=2; i<n-1; i++){
            int temp = max(l2l + nums[i], l);
            l2l = l;
            l = temp;
        }
        int h1 = l;

        //skip first
        l2l = nums[1];
        l = max(nums[1],nums[2]);
        for(int i=3; i<n; i++){
            int temp = max(l2l + nums[i], l);
            l2l = l;
            l = temp;
        }
        int h2 = l;

        return max(h1,h2);
    }
};
```

#### Complexity

* ⏱ Time = `O(n)`
* 🛢 Space = `O(1)` (only 2 variables used)
