# 2877. Create a DataFrame from List

Write a solution to **create** a DataFrame from a 2D list called `student_data`. This 2D list contains the IDs and ages of some students.

The DataFrame should have two columns, `student_id` and `age`, and be in the same order as the original 2D list.

The result format is in the following example.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input:
</strong>student_data:
[
  [1, 15],
  [2, 11],
  [3, 11],
  [4, 20]
]
<strong>Output:
</strong>+------------+-----+
| student_id | age |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 15  |
| 2          | 11  |
| 3          | 11  |
| 4          | 20  |
+------------+-----+
<strong>Explanation:
</strong>A DataFrame was created on top of student_data, with two columns named student_id and age.
</code></pre>





## Solution

```python
import pandas as pd

def createDataframe(student_data: List[List[int]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    column_names = ['student_id','age']
    result = pd.DataFrame(student_data,columns=column_names)
    return result
```
