# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked (the number I picked stays the same throughout the game).

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

* `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
* `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
* `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return _the number that I picked_.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 10, pick = 6
</strong><strong>Output: 6
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 1, pick = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 2, pick = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2`<sup>`31`</sup>` ``- 1`
* `1 <= pick <= n`



## Solution.

```cpp
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        long long low = 1;
        long long high = n;
        
        while(low<=high){
            long long mid=(low+high)/2;
            int temp = guess(mid);

            if(temp==0){
                return mid;
            }else if(temp==-1){
                high=mid-1;
            }else{
                low=mid+1;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
