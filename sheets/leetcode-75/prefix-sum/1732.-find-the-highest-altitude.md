# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point `0` with altitude equal `0`.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the **net gain in altitude** between points `i`​​​​​​ and `i + 1` for all (`0 <= i < n)`. Return _the **highest altitude** of a point._

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong><strong>Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
</strong><strong>Output: 0
</strong><strong>Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `n == gain.length`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`



## Solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
        int maxgain=INT_MIN;
        int currgain=0;
        for(int i=0; i<gain.size(); i++){
            currgain+=gain[i];
            maxgain=max(currgain,maxgain);
        }

        return maxgain<0 ? 0 : maxgain;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity

* **TC = O(n)**
* **SC = O(1)**
