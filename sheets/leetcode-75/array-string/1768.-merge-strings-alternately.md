# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return _the merged string._

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
</strong><strong>Output: "apbqcr"
</strong><strong>Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
</strong>word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
</strong><strong>Output: "apbqrs"
</strong><strong>Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
</strong>word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
</code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
</strong><strong>Output: "apbqcd"
</strong><strong>Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
</strong>word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
* `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.



## Solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        string result;
        while(left < word1.size() && right < word2.size()){
            result.push_back(word1[left]);
            result.push_back(word2[right]);
            left++;
            right++;
        }

        while(left < word1.size()){
            result.push_back(word1[left]);
            left++;
        }

        while(right < word2.size()){
            result.push_back(word2[right]);
            right++;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity

* **TC = O(n+m)** iterating both sides once
* **SC = O(n+m)** storing a string of size n+m
