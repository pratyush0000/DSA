# 2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> worker.

You are also given two integers `k` and `candidates`. We want to hire exactly `k` workers according to the following rules:

* You will run `k` sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
* In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
  * For example, if `costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2]` and `candidates = 2`, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the `4`<sup>`th`</sup> worker because they have the lowest cost `[3,2,7,7,`**`1`**`,2]`.
  * In the second hiring session, we will choose `1`<sup>`st`</sup> worker because they have the same lowest cost as `4`<sup>`th`</sup> worker but they have the smallest index `[3,`**`2`**`,7,7,2]`. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.
* If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
* A worker can only be chosen once.

Return _the total cost to hire exactly_ `k` _workers._

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
</strong><strong>Output: 11
</strong><strong>Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
</strong>- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
The total hiring cost is 11.

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.
</strong>- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [1,2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
The total hiring cost is 4.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= costs.length <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
* `1 <= costs[i] <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
* `1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length`



## Solution.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long totalCost(vector<int>& costs, int k, int candidates) {
        priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> leftk;
        priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> rightk;

        int left = 0;
        int right = costs.size()-1;

        for(int i=0; i<candidates && left <= right; i++){
            leftk.push(costs[left]);
            left++;
        }
        for(int i=0; i<candidates && left <= right; i++){
            rightk.push(costs[right]);
            right--;
        }

        long long cost=0;
        for(int i=0; i<k; i++){
            int lmin = leftk.empty() ? INT_MAX : leftk.top();
            int rmin = rightk.empty() ? INT_MAX : rightk.top();

            if(lmin<=rmin){
                leftk.pop();
                if (left <= right) {
                    leftk.push(costs[left++]);
                }
                cost+=lmin;
            } else{
                rightk.pop();
                if (left <= right) {
                    rightk.push(costs[right--]);
                }
                cost+=rmin;
            }
        }

        return cost;
    }
};
```

#### ⏱ Time Complexity

1. **Initial filling**:
   * You push up to `candidates` elements into `leftk` and up to `candidates` into `rightk`.
   * Each push into a heap of size ≤ `candidates` takes `O(log candidates)`.
   * So filling both heaps = **`O(candidates log candidates)`**.
2. **Main loop (`k` hires)**:
   * Each iteration does a `top()` (O(1)), a `pop()` (O(log candidates)), and possibly a `push()` (O(log candidates)).
   * That’s `O(log candidates)` per iteration.
   * Total = **`O(k log candidates)`**.

👉 So overall:

O(candidates log⁡ candidates + k log⁡ candidates)

or simplified:

O((k+candidates)log⁡candidates)

***

#### 📦 Space Complexity

* Two heaps, each holding at most `candidates` elements.
* So: **`O(candidates)`** (the `*2` factor doesn’t matter in Big-O).
